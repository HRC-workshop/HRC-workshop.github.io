      <p>There is growing awareness that the future of robotics is a collaborative one. Although rapid technological advancements are driving the development and maturation of robotics platforms across a range of domains, the methods by which people work with these platforms remains a largely open question. Unpacking this solution requires a multifaceted approach with key contributions from diverse fields and disciplines, including user modelling, adaptive interfaces, persistent communication, interaction design, human factors, and situational awareness.</p>
<p>This workshop intends to discuss the opportunities, threats, and future of collaborative robotics, by incorporating multidisciplinary perspectives. We invite researchers and practitioners in <em>Human-Computer Interaction</em>, <em>Robotics and Engineering</em>, <em>Ethics</em>, <em>Psychology</em>, <em>Social Sciences</em>, <em>Design</em>, <em>Architecture</em>, and <em>Artificial Intelligence</em> to join us in exploring the requirements for next-generation human-robot collaboration and synthesising a path towards the future where people and robots work hand in hand.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: <em>There is no fee to attend the workshop. However, one author must register for at least one day of the OzCHI 2022 conference</em>. </p>
<h1 id="call-for-participation">Call for participation</h1>
<p>We invite researchers with an interest in shaping the next-generation of <em>human-robot collaboration</em> (<em>HRC</em>) and empowering humans in human-robot teams to submit contributions.

    Professor Dana Kulić conducts research in robotics and human-robot interaction (HRI), and develops autonomous systems that can operate in concert with humans, using natural and intuitive interaction strategies while learning from user feedback to improve and individualize operation over long-term use. She received the combined B. A. Sc. and M. Eng. degree in electro-mechanical engineering, and the Ph. D. degree in mechanical engineering from the University of British Columbia, Canada, in 1998 and 2005, respectively. From 2006 to 2009, Dr. Kulić was a JSPS Post-doctoral Fellow and a Project Assistant Professor at the Nakamura-Yamane Laboratory at the University of Tokyo, Japan. In 2009, Dr. Kulić established the Adaptive System Laboratory at the University of Waterloo, Canada, conducting research in human robot interaction, human motion analysis for rehabilitation and humanoid robotics. Since 2019, Dr. Kulić is a professor and director of Monash Robotics at Monash University, Australia.

  <p>Dr. Eduardo B. Sandoval is a social robotics researcher, his work spans different aspects of social robotics, such as Reciprocity in Human-Robot Interaction (HRI), robots and education, robots and healthcare, and addiction to robots among other topics. Mainly, He is interested in how people make decisions when they interact with robots and other interactive devices. Beyond traditional robotics, there is a growing interest in the idea of designing machines that are capable of meaningful social interactions with humans. His work incorporates insights from behavioural economics and social psychology in order to explore different approaches in social robotics. About his own work, Dr. Sandoval claims: &quot;I can say as a result of working in social robotics I have a better understanding of the human condition.&quot; He holds a PhD in Human Interface Technology at the University of Canterbury, New Zealand, and currently, he is a researcher at the Creative Robotics Lab, University of New South Wales (UNSW), Sydney, Australia.</p>
