There is growing awareness that the future of robotics is a collaborative one. Although rapid technological advancements are driving the development and maturation of robotics platforms across a range of domains, the methods by which people work with these platforms remains a largely open question. Unpacking this solution requires a multifaceted approach with key contributions from diverse fields and disciplines, including user modelling, adaptive interfaces, persistent communication, interaction design, human factors, and situational awareness.  

This workshop intends to discuss the opportunities, threats, and future of collaborative robotics, by incorporating multidisciplinary perspectives. We invite researchers and practitioners in Human-Computer Interaction, Robotics and Engineering, Ethics, Psychology, Social Sciences, Design, Architecture, and Artificial Intelligence to join us in exploring the requirements for next-generation human-robot collaboration and synthesising a path towards the future where people and robots work hand in hand. 

**Note**: There is no fee to attend the workshop. However, one author must register for at least one day of the OzCHI 2022 conference. 

# Call for participation 

We invite researchers with an interest in shaping the next-generation of human-robot collaboration (HRC) and empowering humans in human-robot teams to submit contributions. We encourage submissions on a wide spectrum of topics including (but not limited to) interaction design for HRC, user modelling, multimodal analytics, intention recognition and visualisation, formation and maintenance of trust, ethical HRC, data privacy, safety, socio-technical implications, and design of evaluation metrics.  

Submissions are now invited for the workshop. If you wish to submit a 1–5-page position paper or 1-page expression of interest (EOI) for consideration by the workshop organisers, you must satisfy the selection criteria and follow the submission process. For more information and any queries, please contact us at: stine.johansen@qut.edu.au or hashini.senaratne@data61.csiro.au. Selected position papers and EOIs will be publicly published on the workshop website. 

# Submission Details 


Please include the following in your submission: 

(A) Position papers:  
*   Participants' profile 
*   A description of a topic or challenge that can contribute to workshop discussions 

(B) Expression of Interest (EOI) papers: 
*   Participants' profile  
*   Participants' interest in HRC 

 
Authors should also provide their current city and affiliation (if applicable). 


# Formatting Details 

*   Submission format: Single column format in PDF, using the ACM Master Article Submission Templates (Word and LaTeX versions). 

*   Page length: Position paper submissions should be maximum 5 pages (excluding references), EOI submissions should be maximum 1 page. 

*   Anonymisation: Submissions should not be anonymised. 

*   Submission method: Easy Chair System 

 
The position papers and EOIs must relate directly to the theme of the workshop to explore crucial future research directions for advancing human-robot collaboration and discuss emerging concepts and design decisions, incorporating your discipline-specific perspective.  

# Important Dates 

All times are within the Anywhere on Earth (AoE) time zone. 

*   Submission deadline: 10. October 2022 

*   Notification date: 31. October 2022 

*   Final submission: 14. November 

*   Workshop Day: 29. November 2022 (TBC) 

# Upon Acceptance 

Authors will be provided with a PowerPoint poster template to complete before the workshop. All participants will be invited to join an online community channel to say hello to each other before the conference.
