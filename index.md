There is growing awareness that the future of robotics is a collaborative one. Although rapid technological advancements are driving the development and maturation of robotics platforms across a range of domains, the methods by which people work with these platforms remains a largely open question. Unpacking this solution requires a multifaceted approach with key contributions from diverse fields and disciplines, including user modelling, adaptive interfaces, persistent communication, interaction design, human factors, and situational awareness.  

This workshop intends to discuss the opportunities, threats, and future of collaborative robotics, by incorporating multidisciplinary perspectives. We invite researchers and practitioners in _Human-Computer Interaction_, _Robotics and Engineering_, _Ethics_, _Psychology_, _Social Sciences_, _Design_, _Architecture_, and _Artificial Intelligence_ to join us in exploring the requirements for next-generation human-robot collaboration and synthesising a path towards the future where people and robots work hand in hand. 

_**Note**: There is no fee to attend the workshop. However, one author must register for at least one day of the OzCHI 2022 conference. _

# Call for participation 

We invite researchers with an interest in shaping the next-generation of _human-robot collaboration_ (_HRC_) and empowering humans in human-robot teams to submit contributions. We encourage submissions on a wide spectrum of topics including (but not limited to) _interaction design for HRC_, _user modelling_, _multimodal analytics_, _intention recognition and visualisation_, _formation and maintenance of trust_, _ethical HRC_, _data privacy_, _safety_, _socio-technical implications_, and _design of HRC evaluation metrics_.

# Panellists 

## Dana Kulic (Monash University) 

![Dana](https://engit.monash.edu/profiles/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Dana-Kulic.jpg) Professor Dana Kulić conducts research in robotics and human-robot interaction (HRI), and develops autonomous systems that can operate in concert with humans, using natural and intuitive interaction strategies while learning from user feedback to improve and individualize operation over long-term use. She received the combined B. A. Sc. and M. Eng. degree in electro-mechanical engineering, and the Ph. D. degree in mechanical engineering from the University of British Columbia, Canada, in 1998 and 2005, respectively. From 2006 to 2009, Dr. Kulić was a JSPS Post-doctoral Fellow and a Project Assistant Professor at the Nakamura-Yamane Laboratory at the University of Tokyo, Japan. In 2009, Dr. Kulić established the Adaptive System Laboratory at the University of Waterloo, Canada, conducting research in human robot interaction, human motion analysis for rehabilitation and humanoid robotics. Since 2019, Dr. Kulić is a professor and director of Monash Robotics at Monash University, Australia.  

## Lian Loke (University of Sydney) 

![Lian](https://www.sydney.edu.au/AcademicProfiles/profile/resource?urlid=lian.loke) Associate Professor Lian Loke is Head of Design at the University of Sydney School of Architecture, Design and Planning. She is a member of the Design Lab, the Affective Interactions Lab and the Urban Interfaces Lab.
